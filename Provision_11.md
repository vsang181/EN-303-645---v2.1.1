# 11. Make it easy for users to delete user data 

## Provision 11.1  

**The user shall be provided with functionality such that user data can be erased from the device in a simple manner.** 

> User data in this context means all individual data which is stored on the IoT device including personal data, user configuration and cryptographic material such as user passwords or keys. 

## Provision 11.2 

**The consumer should be provided with functionality on the device such that personal data can be removed from associated services in a simple manner.** 

This functionality is designed for scenarios like transferring ownership, deleting personal data, removing a service from the device, or disposing of the device. It should comply with relevant data protection laws, including the GDPR. "Easily" removing personal data means it should be straightforward with minimal complexity. However, this functionality could potentially be exploited as an attack vector. 

## Provision 11.3 

**Users should be given clear instructions on how to delete their personal data.** 

## Provision 11.4 

**Users should be provided with clear confirmation that personal data has been deleted from services, 

devices and applications.** 

Consumer IoT devices frequently change ownership and eventually are recycled or disposed of. Therefore, mechanisms should be available for consumers to maintain control and erase their personal data from services, devices, and applications. When a consumer wishes to remove their personal data completely, they also expect that backup copies will be deleted retrospectively. 

Deleting personal data from a device or service is often more complicated than just resetting the device to its factory settings. Many scenarios exist where consumers are not the owners of a device but still want to erase their personal data from the device and all related services, such as cloud services or mobile applications. 

> Example: A user can have temporary usage of consumer IoT products within a rented apartment. Carrying out a factory reset of the product can remove configuration settings or disable the device to the detriment of the apartment owner and a future user. A factory reset, deleting all data from the IoT device, would not be an appropriate way to delete the personal data of a single user in a shared use context such as this.
