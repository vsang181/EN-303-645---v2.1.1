# 10. Examine System Telemetry Data 

## Provision 10.1 

**If telemetry data is collected from consumer IoT devices and services, such as usage and measurement data, it should be examined for security anomalies.** 

> Example 1: Security anomalies can be represented by a deviation from normal behaviour of the device, as expressed by the monitored indicators, for example an abnormal increase of failed login attempts 

> Example 2: Telemetry from multiple devices allows a manufacturer to notice that updates are failing due to invalid software update authenticity checks. 

Analyzing telemetry, which includes log data, is valuable for evaluating security and detecting unusual situations promptly. This proactive approach helps minimize security risks by identifying issues early and enables swift problem mitigation.
