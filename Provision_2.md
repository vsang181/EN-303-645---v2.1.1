## 2 Implement a means to manage reports of vulnerabilities 

### Provision 2.1 

There should be a vulnerability disclosure policy available publicly. With keeping the following points in mind while writing the policy- 

• Contain information on how to report issues. 

• Information on timelines for: 

1. Initial acknowledgement of receipt 

2. Status updates until the resolution of the reported issues. 

This policy is a well-defined set of rules for security researchers and anyone who wants to report any issues. The policy should be updated whenever necessary to show more transparency and clarity on the dealing of the manufacturer’s behavior to such issues. 

`Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure` (CVD) is a set of processes defined on how to deal with disclosures about potential security vulnerabilities and to support the remediation of such. CVD is standardized by ISO in [ISO/IEC 29147](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OGSTLcfY7fA20WZAEdvgnUIGqtpoFBhi/view?usp=sharing)  For disclosing vulnerabilities and have been proved successful over time. 

> CVD is not a common thing for the current IoT industry as many of the companies still do not understand how to properly deal with security researchers finding vulnerability in their products/devices. 

### Provision 2.2 

All the vulnerabilities disclosed should be acted on in a timely manner. 

The time-span to act on a discovered vulnerabilities can vary on multiple factors and are always incident specific. However, in general case scenarios it is supposed to be done in 90 days (about 3 months) for a software solution, including availability of patches and notification of the issue. Meanwhile a hardware fix can take longer considering the situation. 

### Provision 2.3 

For the defined support period, manufacturers should continuously monitor, identify and rectify their security vulnerabilities for the devices and services they offer or have offered in the past.

> Manufacturers are expected to exercise due care for all software and hardware components used in the product, this includes due care related to the selected third parties that provide associated services to support the functions of the product.

Vulnerabilities are expected to be reported directly to the affected stakeholders in the first instance. If that is not possible, vulnerabilities can be reported to national authorities. Manufacturers are also encouraged to share informationwith competent industry bodies, such as the GSMA and the IoT Security Foundation. Guidance on Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure is available from the IoT Security Foundation which references [ISO/IEC 29147](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OGSTLcfY7fA20WZAEdvgnUIGqtpoFBhi/view?usp=sharing).

Manufacturers that provide IoT products have a duty of care to consumers and third parties who can be harmed by their failure to have a CVD programme in place.
 
Disclosures can comprise different approaches depending on the circumstances:

- Vulnerabilities related to single products or services: the problem is expected to be reported directly to the affected stakeholder (usually the device manufacturer, IoT service provider or mobile application developer). The source of these reports can be security researchers or industry peers.

- Systemic vulnerabilities: a stakeholder, such as a device manufacturer, can discover a problem that is potentially systemic. Whilst fixing it in the device manufacturer's own product is crucial, there is significant benefit to industry and consumers from sharing this information.

> The Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework ([CVRF](http://docs.oasis-open.org/csaf/csaf-cvrf/v1.2/csaf-cvrf-v1.2.html)) can also be useful to exchange
information on security vulnerabilities.
