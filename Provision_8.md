# 8. Ensure that personal data is secure 

## Provision 8.1 

**The confidentiality of personal data transiting between a device and a service, especially associated services, should be protected, with best practice cryptography.** 

## Provision 8.2 

**The confidentiality of sensitive personal data communicated between the device and associated services shall be protected, with cryptography appropriate to the properties of the technology and usage.** 

> In the context of this provision, "sensitive personal data" is data whose disclosure has a high potential to cause harm to the individual. What is to be treated as "sensitive personal data" varies across products and use cases, but examples are: video stream of a home security camera, payment information, content of communication data and timestamped location data. Carrying out security and data protection impact assessments can help the manufacturer make appropriate choices 

> Associated services in this context are typically cloud services. Moreover these services are controlled or can be influenced by the manufacturer. These services typically are not operated by the user 

> Confidentiality protection often includes integrity protection according to best practice cryptography. 

## Provision 8.3 

**All external sensing capabilities of the device shall be documented in an accessible way that is clear and transparent for the user.** 

> Example: An external sensing capability can be an optic or acoustic sensor.
