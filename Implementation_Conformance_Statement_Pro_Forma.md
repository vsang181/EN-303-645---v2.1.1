# Implementation Conformance Statement Pro Forma

ETSI grants users of this document the freedom to reproduce the pro forma in the annex for its intended purposes and to publish the completed annex, including Table bellow.

Table bellow serves as a mechanism for users, typically entities involved in the development or manufacturing of consumer IoT, to provide information about the implementation of provisions within this document.

The "Reference" column provides references to the provisions in this document.

The "Status" column indicates the status of each provision using the following notations:

- "M" denotes a mandatory requirement.

- "R" denotes a recommendation.

- "M C" denotes a mandatory requirement that is conditional.

- "R C" denotes a recommendation that is conditional.

> Where the conditional notation is used, this is conditional on the text of the provision. The conditions are provided at the bottom of the table with references provided for the relevant provisions to help with clarity.

The "Support" column in Table bellow can be completed by the user of this document. The following notations are used:

- "Y" indicates that the provision is supported by the implementation.

- "N" indicates that the provision is not supported by the implementation.

- "N/A" indicates that the provision is not applicable. This notation is allowed only if a provision is conditional (as indicated in the "Status" column) and if it has been determined that the condition does not apply for the product in question.

The "Detail" column can also be filled in by the user:

- If a provision is supported by the implementation, the entry in the "Detail" column should contain information on the measures that have been implemented to achieve support.

- If a provision is not supported by the implementation, the entry in the "Detail" column should contain information on the reasons why implementation is not possible or not appropriate.

- If a provision is not applicable, the entry in the "Detail" column should contain the rationale for this determination.
