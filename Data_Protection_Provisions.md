# Data Protection Provisions

Consumer IoT devices often handle personal data, so it's important for manufacturers to include features that protect this data. Additionally, there are laws and regulations, such as the GDPR, that govern the protection of personal data in consumer IoT devices. This document aims to assist manufacturers in implementing technical features to safeguard personal data effectively.

## Provision 14.1

**The manufacturer shall provide consumers with clear and transparent information about what personal data is processed, how it is being used, by whom, and for what purposes, for each device and service. This also applies to third parties that can be involved, including advertisers.**

## Provision 14.2

**Where personal data is processed on the basis of consumers' consent, this consent shall be obtained in a valid way.**

Obtaining consent "in a valid way" typically entails providing consumers with a clear and explicit opt-in choice regarding the use of their personal data for a specific purpose. This choice should be freely given, easily noticeable, and straightforward.

## Provision 14.3

**Consumers who gave consent for the processing of their personal data shall have the capability to withdraw it at any time.**

Consumers anticipate the ability to safeguard their privacy by adjusting the settings of IoT device and service functionalities according to their preferences.

## Provision 14.4

**If telemetry data is collected from consumer IoT devices and services, the processing of personal data should be kept to the minimum necessary for the intended functionality.**

## Provision 14.5

**If telemetry data is collected from consumer IoT devices and services, consumers shall be provided with information on what telemetry data is collected, how it is being used, by whom, and for what purposes.**
