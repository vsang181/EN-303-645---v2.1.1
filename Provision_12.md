# 12. Make installation and maintenance of devices easy 

## Provision 12.1  

**Installation and maintenance of consumer IoT should involve minimal decisions by the user and should follow security best practice on usability.** 

> Example: The user uses a wizard to setup the device where a subset of configuration options is presented with the common defaults already specified and with appropriate security options already turned on by default. 

## Provision 12.2 

**The manufacturer should provide users with guidance on how to securely set up their device.** 

Ideally, the process should require minimal human intervention and automatically achieve a secure configuration. 

## Provision 12.3 

**The manufacturer should provide users with guidance on how to check whether their device issecurely set up.** 

Addressing complexity and poor design in user interfaces can significantly reduce or eliminate security issues resulting from consumer confusion or misconfiguration. Providing clear guidance to users on how to configure devices securely can also help minimize their exposure to threats. 

In many cases, the effort required to securely set up a device is higher than the effort needed to verify if it's securely configured. Manufacturers can automate much of this verification process by remotely communicating with the device. This automated process could include validating the device's ability to establish a secure communication channel.
