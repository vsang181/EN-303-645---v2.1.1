# Reporting Implementation

The implementation of provisions in the standard is informed by risk assessment and threat modeling (such as [ISO/IEC 27005:2018](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jNUFU_Ucu4BuxCttP5N6PQoIGjYJj9Tp/view?usp=sharing) ) and [STRIDE Threat Model](STRIDE_model.md).

It is performed by the device manufacturer and/or other relevant entities and is out of scope for the standard. But for certain cases it can be beneficial to apply additional provisions.

The present documentation for the standard sets a security baseline however due to the broad landscape of consumer IoT it is recognized that the applicability of provisions is dependent on each device. It provides a degree of flexibility through the use of non-mandatory "should" provisions.

__________________________________________________________

A justification shall be recorded for each recommendation in the present document that is considered to be not applicable for or not fulfilled by the consumer IoT device.

Cases where a provision is not applicable or not fulfilled by the consumer IoT device can include:

- When a device is a constrained device in such a way that implementation of certain security measures is not possible or not appropriate to the identified risk (security or privacy).

- Where the functionality described in the provision is not included (e.g. a device that only presents data without requiring authentication).

> Example: A window sensor with a limited battery life sends alerts via a remote associated service when triggered and is controlled via a hub. Due to its limited battery life and processing power compared to other consumer IoT devices, it is a constrained device. In addition, because the user controls the device via a hub, the user does not need to use passwords, or other authentication mechanisms, to directly authenticate to the device.
