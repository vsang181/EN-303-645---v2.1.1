# 13. Validate Input Data 

## Provision 13.1  

**The consumer IoT device software shall validate data input via user interfaces or transferred via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) or between networks in services and devices.** 

Systems can be compromised if improperly formatted data or code is transferred across various interfaces. Attackers or testers can utilize automated tools like fuzzers to exploit potential vulnerabilities that arise due to inadequate data validation. 

> Example 1: The device receives data that is not of the expected type, for example executable code rather than user input text. The software on the device has been written so that the input is parameterized or "escaped", preventing this code from being run 

> Example 2: Out of range data is received by a temperature sensor, rather than trying to process this input it identifies that it is outside of the possible bounds and is discarded and the event is captured in telemetry.
