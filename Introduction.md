# Introduction 

The first globally applicable standard for consumer IoT was released by `TC CYBER` in February 2019 and was developed into ETSI EN 303 654, which was released in June 2020. 

It went through `National Standards Organization` comments and voting, engaging even more stakeholders in its development and ultimately strengthening the resulting standard. 

`ETSI` stands for “European telecommunications Standards Institute” & `EN` stands for European. 

It is a high-level security and data protection provision for consumer IoT devices that are connected to network infrastructure and their interactions with Associated services. 

The actual associated services are out of scope for this standard. 

For example- 

- Connected children’s toys and baby monitors 

- Connected smoke detectors, door locks and window sensors 

- IoT gateways, base stations and hubs to which multiple devices connect 

- Smart cameras, TVs and speakers 

- Wearable health trackers 

- Connected home automation and alarm systems, especially their gateways and hubs 

- Connected appliances, such as washing machines and fridges, etc 

- Smart home assistants 

The standard also sets its limits to security considerations to constrained devices. 

This standard is a basic guidance for organizations involved in the development and manufacture of consumer IoT on how to implement security features and requirements. 

Devices that are not consumer IoT devices, for example those that are primarily intended to be used in manufacturing, healthcare or other industrial applications, are not in scope of the present document.
